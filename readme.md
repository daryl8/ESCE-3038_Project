The objective of this project is to create an IoT platform that manages basic appliances that are traditionally managed by the flick of a switch, such as fans and air conditioners, as well as lighting appliances like lights and in-wall lighting fixtures.
The platform should also permit users to communicate with IoT devices via a web page.
The platform will need the following:

1. An Espressif ESP32 development module, which will function as the IoT platform's main sensor unit. 
2. Two devices that will be attached to the ESP32 module and managed by the platform: a lamp and a fan.
3. A RESTful API written using the FastAPI Python framework to be used as a “middle-man”. Your API should allow for effective communication among all components of the platform. 
4. Software and libraries that will allow the ESP32 module to interface with the web API, control connected devices, and connect to linked sensors.
5. A website that will let consumers interact with the gadgets and remote-control them. You'll get access to this. In this situation, it is necessary to implement your API in a way that it can work with the requests made by the website. There will be documentation available.
The implementation of this process is as follows: 
The users should be able to choose a time after which the lights should turn on using this IoT platform's capability. In that case, the IoT platform can only turn on the lights if the current time is later than the user-specified time.
The Internet of Things platform should be able to determine the real time of sunset on that day if the user specifies a time for the lights to turn on at sunset. By adding a sunset API that offers precise sunset times based on the user's location, this service can be made available. The platform may make sure that the lights come on at the right moment by implementing this feature, regardless of whether the user manually sets the time or selects the sunset option. By ensuring that the lights are always on at the appropriate time and preventing unauthorized use of lights during daytime hours, this can improve user experience while also contributing to energy conservation.
The IoT platform should include a feature that allows users to specify a certain temperature after which the fan should be activated. This can be done by using a temperature sensor, such as a digital temperature sensor, connected to the ESP32, which can read/sense the current temperature of the room. The IoT platform can then compare the current temperature to the user-specified temperature and only turn on the fan if the current temperature is higher.
The IoT platform should also include a sensor that can detect whether a person is present in the room. This can be accomplished using a passive infrared (PIR) sensor, for example, which detects changes in infrared radiation that occur when a person moves within its field of view. The IoT platform can then use this information to determine whether to turn on the lights.
The controlled appliances should only switch on if each of the required conditions is satisfied using a combination of the temperature-based control, time-base control, and presence detection features of the IoT platform. 
Using logical programming that verifies the following, this can be achieved:
Consider both the data from the presence sensor and the current temperature before choosing whether to turn on the fan.
Consider the presence sensor data as well as the current time before choosing whether to turn on the lights.
Users should be able to alter various parameters to provide them more control over the IoT platform. The user should, for instance, be able to adjust the temperature at which the fan should activate. The user should also have the option to set the time after which the lights turn on and how long they should stay on. Through a web interface, the user can enter their desired values to access these programmable options. These customization possibilities enable the IoT platform to be adapted to the unique requirements of the user, enhancing its effectiveness and user-friendliness.
To provide users with greater control over the IoT platform, they should be able to customize various settings. For example, the user should be able to specify the temperature at which the fan should turn on. Similarly, the user should be able to customize the time after which the lights should turn on and the duration for which they should stay on. These customizable settings can be accessed via a web interface that allows the user to input their preferred values. By providing these customization options, the IoT platform can be tailored to the specific needs of the user, making it more effective and user-friendly.
These functions can be added to the IoT platform to guarantee that lights only turn on when they are required. This can prevent unwanted light pollution and save energy. A person must also be present and the room must be warmer than the user-specified temperature before the fan will operate. This can reduce energy use and improve living conditions.
To enhance the user experience and provide users with more information about the environmental conditions in the room, students should include a request method that returns the n most recent sensor readings from the IoT platform to the webpage. "https://simple-smart-hub-client.netlify.app"
Graphs showing how the temperature has varied over a period of time and how much time is spent in the room may then be created using this data and shown on the website. 

Users who have access to this historical data can learn more about how the room's temperature changes and use that knowledge to better plan when to turn on the fan or adjust the thermostat. Additionally, the ability to graphically display temperature data can assist users in better comprehending the connection between temperature and fan performance, which can result in increased energy efficiency and a more comfortable living space.
It is important also to note that all processing and decision-making be handled by the API rather than the microcontroller to guarantee the IoT platform runs smoothly and effectively. Only the commands issued by the server-app in response to user input and/or sensor data should be the responsibility of the microcontroller. 

The API can handle sophisticated decision-making processes using this method, such as deciding whether the temperature is too high to turn on the fan or whether someone is in the room, in which case the lights should be turned on. By avoiding difficult computations, the microcontroller may concentrate on carrying out the instructions received from the server-app, assuring the system's dependability and seamless operation.
The suggested hardware components are as follows: ESP32, DC relay, MOSFET, Digtal temp sensor On board BLE, PIR sensor, 12V PC fan, 12V light, LED, LM7805 voltage regulator (5v), ad 12 DC power supply. 

Overrall in this project, a Espressif ESP32 development module was used as the primary sensor unit to create an IoT platform. The ESP32 module-connected lamp and fan was to be controlled by the platform. The FastAPI Python framework was then used to develop a RESTful API, facilitating communication across all platform elements. The ESP32 module used programs and libraries to interact with the web API and manage the connected appliances. The users will be able to connect with and manage the devices remotely via a webpage on the platform as well. To ensure seamless integration and functionality, the API was created to be compliant with the requests made by the website.
